# Airbnb Clone Project

## üöÄ Overview

The Airbnb Clone is a full-stack web application that replicates the core features of Airbnb. It is designed to help developers gain hands-on experience with backend architecture, database design, API development, and deployment strategies.

## üèÜ Project Goals

- Implement secure user authentication and profile management.
- Enable property listing creation, retrieval, update, and deletion.
- Develop a full-featured booking and payment system.
- Build a review and rating system for listed properties.
- Apply CI/CD best practices for seamless integration and deployment.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Django, Django REST Framework
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Query Language:** GraphQL
- **Asynchronous Tasks:** Celery, Redis
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, Docker Hub

| Technology                      | Purpose                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Django**                      | A high-level Python web framework used to build and manage the backend of the application, including API endpoints and business logic.                         |
| **Django REST Framework (DRF)** | An extension for Django that simplifies building RESTful APIs with serializers, authentication, and permissions.                                               |
| **GraphQL**                     | A flexible query language that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, reducing over-fetching and improving efficiency.                          |
| **PostgreSQL**                  | A powerful, open-source relational database used to store and manage application data, including users, properties, bookings, and payments.                    |
| **Celery**                      | A distributed task queue used for handling asynchronous operations like sending notifications or processing background jobs.                                   |
| **Redis**                       | An in-memory data structure store used for caching, session management, and as a message broker for Celery.                                                    |
| **Docker**                      | A containerization tool used to package the application and its dependencies into portable containers, ensuring consistency across development and deployment. |
| **GitHub Actions**              | A CI/CD tool used to automate testing, linting, and deployment workflows whenever code changes are pushed to the repository.                                   |
