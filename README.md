## 🗃️ Database Design

This section outlines the core database entities, key fields, and relationships in the Airbnb Clone project.

### 🔹 Entities and Key Fields

#### 1. **User**

- `id`: Unique identifier for the user
- `name`: Full name of the user
- `email`: User’s email address (unique)
- `password`: Encrypted password for authentication
- `role`: Specifies if the user is a guest or host

#### 2. **Property**

- `id`: Unique property identifier
- `title`: Title or name of the property
- `description`: Detailed property description
- `location`: Address or coordinates of the property
- `host_id`: Foreign key referencing the User (host)

#### 3. **Booking**

- `id`: Unique booking identifier
- `user_id`: Foreign key referencing the User (guest)
- `property_id`: Foreign key referencing the Property
- `check_in_date`: Start date of the booking
- `check_out_date`: End date of the booking

#### 4. **Review**

- `id`: Unique review identifier
- `user_id`: Foreign key referencing the User
- `property_id`: Foreign key referencing the Property
- `rating`: Numeric rating value

- `status`: Payment status (e.g., completed, pending, failed)

### 🔗 Entity Relationships

- A **User** can host multiple **Properties**.
- A **User** can make multiple **Bookings**.
- A **Booking** is associated with one **User** (guest) and one **Property**.
- A **Review** is made by a **User** and is linked to one **Property**.
- A **Payment** is linked to one **Booking**.

This relational model ensures efficient data access, referential integrity, and clear data flow for user actions like listing properties, making bookings, and processing payments.

## ✨ Feature Breakdown

The Airbnb Clone project consists of essential features that replicate the core functionality of a modern booking platform. Each feature is designed to enhance user experience and reflect real-world business logic.

### 🔹 User Management

Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. It includes authentication and role-based access (e.g., guest or host), ensuring secure and personalized user experiences.

### 🔹 Property Management

Enables hosts to list, update, and delete their properties. Each property includes details like photos, pricing, and availability, giving potential guests full insight into accommodations.

### 🔹 Booking System

Provides guests with the ability to search for properties, select available dates, and make bookings. This system handles reservation logic and prevents double-booking.

### 🔹 Review System

Lets guests leave reviews and ratings after their stays. This promotes transparency and trust between users by highlighting property quality and host reliability.

### 🔹 Payment Integration

Handles secure payment processing for bookings. Includes features like payment status tracking and method selection, ensuring safe and efficient transactions.

### 🔹 Admin Panel (Optional Advanced Feature)

An administrative dashboard for managing users, properties, and bookings. Useful for overseeing system activity and performing moderation or data correction.

## 🔒 API Security

Securing our backend APIs is essential to ensure the integrity, privacy, and trustworthiness of the Airbnb Clone platform. Below are the key security measures and their purposes:

### 🔐 Authentication

We will implement secure authentication mechanisms using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth 2.0 to verify user identity. This ensures that only legitimate users can access their accounts and interact with the system.

**Why it's crucial**: Prevents unauthorized access to user accounts and protects sensitive data such as email, personal information, and preferences.

### 🛂 Authorization

Role-based access control (RBAC) will be enforced to ensure users can only access resources and actions permitted for their roles (e.g., host, guest, admin).

**Why it's crucial**: Protects system functionality by restricting access to sensitive operations, such as deleting properties or modifying bookings.

### 🚦 Rate Limiting

API rate limiting will be applied to prevent abuse and DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks. Users will have a defined number of requests allowed per minute/hour.

**Why it's crucial**: Preserves backend performance, protects against brute force attacks, and ensures fair usage for all users.

### 🔒 HTTPS & Data Encryption

All API communication will be secured with HTTPS, and sensitive data (like passwords and payment info) will be encrypted using secure hashing algorithms and tokenization techniques.

**Why it's crucial**: Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks, eavesdropping, and data leaks.

### 📊 Input Validation & Error Handling

Strict validation of API inputs will be implemented to prevent common exploits like SQL injection, XSS (Cross-site scripting), and other injection attacks. Clear but secure error messages will be returned.

**Why it's crucial**: Ensures data integrity and system stability, while preventing attackers from exploiting vulnerabilities.

These security layers work together to protect the application, user data, and payment transactions, making the platform resilient to threats and maintaining user trust.
